# Just in Case 

This project is part of the "Foundations of Networks and Mobile Systems" class at NYU Stern. 

Just In Case is a web platform that will function as an e-commerce platform where customers can leave gifts for their loved ones upon their passing. The customer will pre-send letters, gifts, etc. through the platform and Just In Case will delivery these items to the loved one after the death of the customer.

This project was written in HTML, CSS for the frontend and Python Flask in the backend.
